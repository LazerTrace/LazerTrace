TUT Selftest README
===================

NB: If you're here looking for an example of how to use TUT framework,
it's the wrong place: testing TUT using TUT itself produces messed
code where one test runner controls lifecycle of another, and tests
of outer runner are mixed with tests of inner. Selftest is a VERY
special case, so you'd better look into example/ directory.

TUT Selftest is to show that TUT framework works correctly under 
your combination of platform and compiler (or to show opposite). In
any case you'll get a deterministic answer. TUT is considered as working
IF AND ONLY IF all tests of Selftest are passed, no exceptions and no
failures encountered.
