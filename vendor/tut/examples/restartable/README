This catalog contains example implementation of restartable 
unit tests. The tests get SIGSEGV which terminates test application
(four times!) but after restart tests are continued from the point 
AFTER test that forced crash, so you may get more complete image 
of what's broken. 

It could be especially useful at night tests.
